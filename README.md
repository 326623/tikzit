TikZiT is a graphical tool for rapidly creating an editing node-and-edge style graphs. It was originally created to aid in the typesetting of "dot" diagrams of interacting quantum observables (see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4725">arXiv:0906.4725</a>), but can be used as a general graph editing program.
