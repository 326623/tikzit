For building on systems other than MacOS/X:

Dependencies:
  GNUstep (core libraries) >= 1.18.0
  gtk+-2.0 >= 2.18.0
  poppler (including glib bindings, which may be in
    a separate poppler-glib package)
  Objective C compiler (eg: gcc with ObjC support) with
    support for properties, optional protocols and
    fast enumeration (eg: gcc 4.6 or clang).

To install, just run:

  ./configure
  make
  make install



To build from subversion (and for development) you will additionally need:
  lex (eg: flex)
  yacc (eg: bison)
  autoconf >= 2.60
  automake

and you will need to prepare the source tree by running
  aclocal
  autoconf
  automake --add-missing
