Building on OSX:

You'll need QT5 and poppler with QT5 bindings. QT5 can be installed with Homebrew:

$ brew install qt5

whereas poppler should be built from source to get the QT5 bindings. To compile, clang needs to have C++11 features enabled. I built using:

$ CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11" ./configure
$ CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11" make
